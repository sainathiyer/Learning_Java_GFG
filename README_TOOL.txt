Here's a simple workflow breakdown based on your Snowflake implementation. This is designed for you to easily translate into a Microsoft Visio block diagram:

1. PII Data Upload (Source)
PII Data Clients (Banks/Financial Institutions):
Send individual PII data in XML format.
2. Stage in Snowflake (Staging Area)
Snowflake Stage:
Stores incoming PII data files temporarily before parsing and processing.
3. Temp Table Creation (PII Data Storage)
Temporary Table:
Temporary storage in Snowflake for processing the incoming PII data.
4. Parsing and Loading (UDF Parsing Logic)
UDF (Java-based):
Parses the incoming XML.
Extracts the relevant PII data and loads it into the PII_DATA Table.
5. PII_DATA Table (Storing Masked Data)
PII_DATA Table:
Stores the parsed and masked PII data with the following masking policies applied:
Role-based Masking
Differential Privacy Admin Policies
Schema-based Masking
Projection Policies
6. Trade File Upload (Source)
Trade File Upload:
Trade data uploaded from clients in XML format.
7. Stage for Trade Files (Trade Data)
Snowflake Stage for Trade Data:
Stores the incoming trade files temporarily.
8. Temp Table for Trade Data
Temporary Table (Trade Data):
Temporary storage in Snowflake for processing trade data.
9. Extract Vault ID (UDF Logic)
UDF (Python-based):
Extracts PII Vault ID from the trade XML.
10. Enriching Trade Data with PII (Enrichment UDF)
Enrichment UDF (Python-based):
Extracts Vault ID from trade data.
Matches Vault ID with data in the PII_DATA Table.
Enriches the trade XML with the corresponding PII data (using matched Vault ID).
Generates the enriched XML.
11. S3 File Generation
S3 Bucket:
Enriched XML is stored in an S3 Bucket for future use.
12. Final Submission
Submission to NCA:
Enriched data is now ready for submission to the National Competent Authority (NCA).
High-Level Flow:
PII Data Client → Snowflake Stage (PII Data) → Parse XML (UDF Java) → PII_DATA Table
Trade Data Client → Snowflake Stage (Trade Data) → Extract Vault ID (UDF Python) → Enrich Data (UDF Python) → Store Enriched XML in S3
Final Enriched XML → Ready for submission to NCA.
Flow Diagram Key:
Rectangles represent processes or stages.
Arrows represent data flow.
Diamonds can represent decision points (like checking Vault ID matches).
Cylinders can represent databases or storage locations like Snowflake tables or S3.
